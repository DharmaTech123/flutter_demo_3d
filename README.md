# flutter_demo_3d

What better way to learn a new framework than a bit of 3D?  Now I'm not suggesting you'd use this for anything serious.  It's rendered entirely on the CPU for one, no fancy GPU accelleration here.  We load the model, trasform, rotate scale and render to a custom canvas.

## Included in the Project

A Wavefront .OBJ parser<br/>
Custom painting on a canvas<br/>
Loading bundled assets at runtime<br/>
An example of using drag gestures<br/>
